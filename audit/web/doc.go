// Package web is a little helper package for the unit testing of web
// applications. The contained test server allows to test individual handlers
// or with the multiplexer and more helping handers the mocking of external
// web APIs. The helper types for request and reply simplify the testing of
// own handlers in many cases. Marshalling data based on the content-type is
// done here automatically for some common types. Both also contain asserts.
