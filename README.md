## Description

*Tideland Go Library* provides a number of helpful packages for different areas. They
are grouped by higher level packages.

- `audit` provides packages to support testing with better asserts, generators, environment
  manipulation, and capturing of STDOUT and STDERR
- `dsa` contains data structures and algorithms like collections and sorting, identifier
  generation, e.g. UUIDs, and map/reduce
- `text` simplifies life with text data, text based configurations in the LISP like 
  simple markup language SML, with schemeless JSON, and the processing of continuously 
  written text lines
- `together` focusses on goroutines and how to manage them more convenient and reliable
- `trace` helps doing monitoring and logging as well as with error handling

I hope you like it. ;)
